## Welcome to my website

I'm Nathan Russell, PhD student at University of Otago (since April 2020) and a little dog obsessed.
 My research is centred around the use of machine learning in a clinical context, using it to improve the decsions made, our understanding and hopefully a benefit to the patient as a result.
