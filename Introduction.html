<h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
<p>I'm Nathan Russell, PhD student at University of Otago (since April 2020) and a little dog obsessed.
My research is centred around the use of machine learning in a clinical context, using it to improve the decsions made, our understanding and hopefully a benefit to the patient as a result. </p>
